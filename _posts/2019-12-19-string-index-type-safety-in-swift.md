Code is much like a conversation, and misunderstandings can happen when assumptions aren’t stated upfront. It brings to mind
a quote (perhaps apocryphal) from the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire: “If you wish to converse with me, first define your
terms.” Though he is unlikely to have anticipated how this advice might apply to computer science, it rings true when considering
the code development process. Misunderstandings lead to bugs—which our team found out when working with our iOS text
manipulation logic.
